## What I Learned

- **React Basics:** I got hands-on experience with React components, state management, and lifecycle methods.
- **Conditional Rendering:** I learned how to display different UI elements based on game state (e.g., showing the winner or a draw message).
- **Event Handling:** Handling clicks on the board squares and updating the game state was a great learning opportunity.
- **Project Structure:** Organizing components, assets, and styles in a clean folder structure.
- **Deployment:** Deploying the app to platforms like GitHub Pages.
